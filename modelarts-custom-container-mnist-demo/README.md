# ModelArts Custom Container MNIST DEMO



## Getting started

The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training
samples, and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each
containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.
The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition
methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
